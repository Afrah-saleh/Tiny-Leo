# Tiny Leo

Welcome to the repository for my game Tiny Leo which has been developed as part of a 3-day game development bootcamp. In this action-packed game, you must navigate through a series of challenges, avoid enemies, collect coins, and reach the final, large coin to win.

## Gameplay

Your objective is to reach the end of the level where a big coin awaits you. However, the journey is fraught with dangers:

- **Enemies**: Avoid or defeat enemies that will reduce your health upon contact.
- **Coins**: Collect smaller coins scattered throughout the level for points.
- **Health**: Keep an eye on your health bar; if it depletes, it's game over.
- **End Coin**: Reaching and collecting the big coin at the end of the level means victory.

When the game is over or you win, you will be presented with two options:

- **Play Again**: Restart the game and try to beat your previous score.
- **Quit**: Exit the game.

## Controls

- **Arrow keys**: Move the character left/right .
- **Spacebar**:  jump .
